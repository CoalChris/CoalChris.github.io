         blurb: "A former delinquent and bully, a deaf girl, and the desire to make things right. The premises of the film are highly promising, but did director Naoko Yamada and Kyoto Animation's finest animation artisans deliver?",
         text: "<b>NOTE: THIS CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS</b><br><br>In the lead up to A Silent Voice's western premier, you may have heard that it was the 2016 anime film which was overshadowed by box office record breaker and current top anime (both films and series) Your Name. Seeing as it's currently ranked #14 on MyAnimeList's Top Anime chart, it's no surprise everyone has been looking forward to its premier in other countries. The film hit Sydney cinemas two weeks ago and I took the liberty of organising to visit a screening with some friends. Here are my thoughts on whether the film hit its mark or ricocheted right back.<br><br>As we find out quickly in the film and from all the promotional materials for the film's debut, the basis of the film has Ishida Shouya trying to atone for his past actions of bullying a deaf classmate, Nishimiya Shouko, in elementary school. The opening shots establish the instability Ishida is currently experiencing now in high school. He has given up on making friends because of the 'friends' who betrayed him in the past. He only wishes to repay his family for the trouble he caused as a bully, and selfishly disappear from this world he doesn't belong in. By fate, he bumps into Nishimiya again, and begins his quest of atonement. It's crucial here to understand the point A Silent Voice is making up right from the start. Bullying plagues our society, and as the film later depicts, this plague isn't limited to students, but even adults. Sometimes the bullies feel the repercussions of their actions in guilt, others don't. Here in A Silent Voice we see both, where students who didn't physically bully or did so comparably less than another student would hold a clean conscience and deny participating in these activities. A Silent Voice's stance on bullying is the most powerful message throughout the film and resonates in viewers.<br><br>As the plot unravels, Ishida and Nishimiya continue to understand more about friendship and love. They slowly begin to overcome their struggles and come to face their elementary school classmates and each other head on. Ishida's goal is to reunite them all and create the friendships they never had with Nishimiya. However, as they find out, not everyone is accepting of these ideals. In particular, Ueno never acknowledges a friendship with Nishimiya and instead ridicules her very existence which caused everything to fall apart in elementary school. While this could be interpreted as a continuation of the bullying in the past, or a stubbornness and hatred against Nishimiya even after acknowledging the severity of Ueno's past actions, it serves a greater purpose in Nishimiya's character development. While Ishida and Nishimiya continue to grow closer and rely on each other, Ueno's accusations continue to sink deeper into Nishimiya's mind. She is unable to love herself anymore because of the repercussions of her existence on Ishida and company's lives in elementary school. We watch as the drama of both the protagonist and heroine stretch them to their limits. We laugh with them in their happy times together, we cry for them as they're separated from their friends once again. This film is honestly a rollercoaster ride through every emotion for viewers. The last sprint of the film sees the climax and friendship the main 'couple' have, and what love is capable of.<br><br>Notice how I have been focusing almost entirely on the protagonist and heroine. That is because the director has chosen to remove all back-story from supporting characters during adaption from the manga source, with the exception of what we know from past events in elementary school, and Nishimiya's sister who seems to be the only developed support character. I have been told the manga helps to understand these supporting characters, but from the perspective of someone who simply watched the film, it felt like most of these characters didn't have particular significance. Some appeared once or twice, others throughout the entire duration of the film, but none were properly developed and often the viewer would be confused as to what was happening. For myself, I couldn't help but laugh at the unpredictable and ridiculous actions of these supporting characters. The lack of development here is definitely the bane of A Silent Voice, and what ruined the film for me during the screening.<br><br>Looking at the art style and music, Kyoto Animation has managed to pull off another masterpiece. The art is reminiscient of other Kyoto Animation titles such as K-On! and Tamako Love Story. The background music and sound effects capture the emotions of every scene and deliver it to the audience, heightening the experience and forcing viewers into the shoes of characters. You will notice that Naoko often uses silence or ambient sounds to emphasise character emotions, along with the theme of sign language to communicate through visuals rather than scripted lines. The ending theme, 'Koi wo Shita no wa' sung by aiko, beautifully finishes the tale of adolescent love, friendships and self-worth.<br><br>A Silent Voice is definitely a film with outstanding qualities in most individual aspects. A brilliant blend of deep, real and relatable themes, a protagonist and heroine which strikes us with their development, and brought alive through Naoko's directing and the film's illustrators, animators, sound engineers and musicians. However, I was unable to accept the film for what it is due to the worst support characters in anime film history. By all means watch the film, but expect to be frustrated every time a support character appears on screen."

         blurb: "The Halal Snack Pack (otherwise known as the HSP) is one of Australia's greatest food inventions. Taking off in a crazy hype in 2015, the infamous box of Middle-Eastern cuisine mixed with good ol' chips can now be found in just about every local kebab shop across all major cities. You'll want to know what you're looking for before heading out in search of some 'snackies' though!",
         text: "Finding a kebab shop in Sydney isn't too hard. Sydney CBD, Northern Suburbs, North Shore, Inner West, nearly every suburb has a local Mecca serving you piping hot kebabs now. Are Halal Snack Packs any different?<br><br>It turns out that most joints don't make the cut. Using a variety of measurements, Aussies in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/HalalSnackPackAppreciationSociety/\" target=\"_blank\">Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society</a>, the biggest Facebook group and what started this new HSP movement, have managed to rank HSP-serving shops and weed out those who can't keep up with competition. These measurements include the shop owner's greeting, shop display, halal certification, pricing, HSP packaging, meat quality, chips quality, and finally the choice of sauces, with the 'Holy Trinity' (Chilli, BBQ, Garlic) being the standard choice for HSP fans. Highly rated snack packs are referred to as 'halal' snack packs, whereas low-scoring snack packs will be deemed 'haram'. It's not surprising that individuals who choose to eat the worst snack packs, especially those who choose tomato sauce or add salad, are branded as 'haram dingoes'. A list of the best kebab shops across Australia can be found on the HSP Appreciation Society page.<br><br>Today I visited the esteemed Metro One Kebab, Pizza & Pide in Ashfield, Sydney. It'd been half a year since my last snack pack and I'd been keen for another artery-clogging experience of juicy doner kebab meat and freshly fried hot chips. Together with 5 friends, we entered the open store front to be greeted with a 'What can I get for you?' while gazing at the lit up boards and neon signs reassuring us of the halal certified meat. HSP usually come in a variety of sizes where single person servings come in takeaway styrofoam boxes. A regular is enough for your average bloke and costs about AUD$10 in most places. A large is more than what you'd want and sets you back another $3 or so. Additional cheese? Go for it, another dollar or two. We decided instead to tackle the $55 large 15\" pizza box HSP (refer to the photo above) with cheese and mixed meat, approximately the size of four large HSP. It came with a free 1.25L bottle of soft drink. It was the 6 of us versus the equivalent of 4 large HSP, we figured this way we had the option of going home full instead of sprawled on the ground gasping for breath after a deathly amount of meat, chips and sauce. The meat was about the same as most places (saturated and delicious), but the chips were only slightly crunchy. Crunchy chips are what set apart the best HSP from the mediocre ones. For reference, I think the #1 kebab shop nearby in Campbelltown, King Kebab House, is the only place with golden crunchy chips. The top was lathered with the 'Holy Trinity', finishing the masterpiece of a HSP. All in all, it was a fairly good HSP and great value feed, but it just left me craving for the king in Campbelltown.<br><br>Interestingly enough, NSW Senator Sam Dastyari, known for his comical interactions with One Nation Party's founder and leader Pauline Hanson, was filming some footage on food and multiculturalism in Metro One. I definitely didn't let this opportunity slip away and decided to sneak some hilarious poses in, show off my swag and photo-bombing skills. Sam actually came around and interviewed a few of the tables, including us, and I'm waiting eagerly to see the video uploaded online.<br><br>If you're looking for reliable snack packs, I would definitely stop by each of the HSP Appreciation Society recommendations. Although, any nearby kebab shop should suffice if you don't care about soggy chips. Good luck hunting for the best HSP!"

         blurb: "Easter is a time of celebration all across the globe. This festive season is represented by delicious chocolate eggs and bunnies, but what's the back story behind this annual event?",
         text: "The Easter bunny and colourful eggs are familiar to all of us, and they're the focus of Easter in the consumer world. Many people understand Easter is somehow related to a man called Jesus, but aren't sure about the specifics. There is indeed a very deep and complex history behind Easter and various reasons for people celebrating Easter today.<br><br>Some evidence suggests that the word 'Easter' might be taken from the German folklore goddess of spring, Eostre, or the German word for Easter, Ostern, which means 'East'. The bunny, or hare, is a symbol of fertility because of their ability to quickly multiply. The egg is a sign of birth and life. These three things don't seem to be related, but were commonly celebrated in spring fertility rituals during the days of the ancient Roman Catholic Church. Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the Sunday, and in order to make this celebration more attractive to non-Christians, the Roman Catholic Church decided to adopt Easter as the celebratory day of Christ rising back to life. We see now that Easter's origins have nothing to do with Jesus, but both Christians and non-Christians hold celebrations at the same time of the year!<br><br>Knowing the origins of Easter, should Christians be celebrating Easter? Is it okay to stuff our faces with chocolate? By all means enjoy a bunny (or two), but remember that the true reason that Christians hold celebrations is to express their joy at Jesus Christ' resurrection and the completion of God's plan. Although, this should be on our minds every day, not just during Easter.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.desiringgodchurch.org/web/2009/04/09/why-did-jesus-have-to-die/\" target=\"_blank\">If you are wondering why Jesus needed to die and resurrect, this article explains it in an easily understandable way.</a>"
